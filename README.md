# Covid-Case-Recorder
An android application for viewing and recording Covid Cases

The purpose of this project was to build an android application to be used by an employee of the Ministry of Citizen Protection to record new covid cases.
The application used FireBase to keep and validate user accounts. 

When logging into the app, the user's geolocation was used to determine whether or not  the employee was at his designated workplace, reminding him that Covid cases could only be done  while  within the workspace.
Within the application's main menu the user has access to the following functionalities:

- Add New Case  &  Edit Existing Case:
  This menu included fields to be filled by the  employee for recording a covid case or making corrections in previously recorded ones.

- View Statistics:
  This menu provided interractive statistical info charts based on the cases the employee had recorded thus far  tied to his  account.

- View Global case map:
  This menu implemented the dynamic covid case map from Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center that could be  viewed and filtered through from within the application.

Navigating through the app supported voice commands as well as toggling between Greek or English for the UI.
